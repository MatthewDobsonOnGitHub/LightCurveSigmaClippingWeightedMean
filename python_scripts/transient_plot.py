# DATA PLOTTING

# Now, we plot the data on the graph. 
# Note, we have errors associated with the y-values of the data, and so must be plotted also. To do this, we use the errorbar() function.
# 'fmt' determines the style (1st letter) and colour (2nd letter) of the datapoints; 'o' makes circular points, 'b' makes blue points.
#capsize determines the size of the error bar caps.
# linestyle determies the style of the line that joins the data points; here, we leave it blank, so no line is formed.

plt.plot(x, y,'ob')




# Setting the titles for the x- and y-axes.
# x-axis is time in units if Modified Julian Date.
# y-axis is magnitude of transient's light.

plt.xlabel('MJD')
plt.ylabel('Transient Magnitude')




# We can also set gridlines and tick marks on the graph.

plt.minorticks_on()
plt.grid(which='major', linestyle=':')
plt.grid(which='minor', linestyle=':')




# Remembering that the more negative the magnitude the brighter the transient
# we reverse the direction of the y-axis.

plt.gca().invert_yaxis()




# Before plotting the figure, we save it

plt.savefig('mag_plot_1.pdf')




# Now we display the figure itself!

plt.show()
