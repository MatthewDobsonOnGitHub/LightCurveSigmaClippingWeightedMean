Dear Barnab√°s,

My name is Matthew Dobson, and I am a student working under Prof. Stephen Smart at the Astrophysics Research centre at Queens' University Belfast.

Please find attached to this email a datafile containing all the measurements of flux of the supernova SN2019muj, along with the weighted mean flux values, binned by day. Additionally, a plot of flux as a function of time is also attached; the top subplot is the raw flux data as a function of time; the bottom subplot is both the raw data (faded cyan and orange) and the weighted mean flux values (red and blue, for the orange and cyan filters, respectively). It should be noted that 2-sigma clipping does not result in any omission of datapoints.

Yours sincerely,

Matthew Dobson
